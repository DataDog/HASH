# HASH (HTTP Agnostic Software Honeypot)

HASH is a framework for creating and launching low interactive honeypots. 

![HASH](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataDog/HASH/main/docs/hash-intro.png "HASH")




# ðŸŒŸ Why HASH?
The main philosophy of HASH is to be easy to configure and flexible to mimic any software running on HTTP/HTTPs. With the minimum footprint possible to avoid being detected as honeypot.


# âš¡ Features

* Single framework to deploy HTTP/HTTPs based honeypots
* Easily configurable via YAML files
* Built-in honeytraps
* Powerful randomization based on `fakerjs` to avoid honeypot detection
* Optionally, integration with Datadog to ingest and analyze honeypots logs and HTTP requests through APM




# ðŸš€ Getting Started
HASH is built using Node.js but it can mimic any web-based language / server based on the configuration. Read the full docs below.


## Installation


### You can Install it via NPM 

```
npm install -g hash-honeypot
```


### Or you can use it directly from docker

```
docker run --rm ghcr.io/datadog/hash help
```


## Usage

### Generate honeypot profile
HASH uses YAML files to configure how it simulate the desired software, The typical structure for the profile folder is the following

```
|____templates
|     |____resources
|     |     |____index.html
|     |     |____style.css
|     |     |____favicon.ico
|     |____404.yaml
|     |____default.yaml
|____init.yaml
```

You can build it yourself or you can generate it using `generate` command

```
Usage: HASH generate [options] <folder>

Generate honeypot profile

Arguments:
  folder                         path/to the app

Options:
  -t --template <template_name>  base template (default: "default")
  -n --name <honeypot_name>      Honeypot name
  -s --swagger <swagger_file>    Path to swagger file to convert
  -h, --help                     display help for command
```

**Example**

```
hash-honeypot generate myhoneypot --name my-honey-pot --template default
```


You can also convert swagger files to honeypot directly from the `generate` command

**Example converting swagger file(s) to honeypot**

```
hash-honeypot generate sample-swagger2 -n sample -s ./test-swagger/test-swagger.yaml
```


### Running the honeypot

```
Usage: HASH run [options] <folder>

Run HASH

Arguments:
  folder                     path/to the template folder

Options:
  -l, --log <transport>      logging transport (default: "console,file,datadog")
  -f, --log_file <filename>  logging filename (default: "hash.log")
  -h, --help                 display help for command
```


**example**

```
hash-honeypot my-honeypot-profile -l file -f ./logs/hash.log
```

> If you are using Datadog for logs make sure you export the datadog api key `export DD_API_KEY=<your-api-key>`




## Customization and configuration

You can customize the your honeypot profile as you want 


**Example request template:**

```yaml
id: sqli-error
info:
    title: "SQL error honeytrap"
requests:
  - isTrap: false 
    expect:
      method: GET
      path: '/author/:Id([0-9]+)'
    reply:
      status: 200
      headers:
        content-type: "text/html"
      body: 
        view: "author.html"
  - isTrap: true 
    expect:
      method: GET
      path: '/author/:Id'
    reply:
      status: 500
      headers:
        content-type: "text/html"
      body: 
        contents: "You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '' at line 2"
```

Read the configuration reference [here](./docs/config.md) or see the examples [here](./Examples). 


## Future work
- [X] Create examples folder to show HASH features
- [X] Ability to import API documentation formats (swagger ..etc)
- [X] Package hash as module for easier distribution
- [ ] Add capabilities for medium interactions
- [ ] Add popular honeytraps
- [ ] Add unit & integration tests
