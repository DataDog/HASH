# HASH (HTTP Agnostic Software Honeypot)
Hash is a framework for creating and launching low interactive honeypots. 


![HASH](./docs/hash-intro.png "HASH")

# ðŸŒŸ Why HASH?
The main philosophy of HASH is to be easy to configure and flexible to mimic any software running on HTTP/HTTPs. With the minimum footprint possible to avoid being detected as honeypot.


# âš¡ Features

* Single framework to deploy HTTP/HTTPs based honeypots
* Easily configurable via YAML files
* Built-in honeytraps
* Out-of-the box integration with Datadog to review the honeypot logs
* Powerful randomization based on `fakerjs` to avoid honeypot detection


# ðŸš€ Getting Started
HASH is built using Node.js but it can mimic any web based language / server based on the configuration. Read the full docs here:


## Installation

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your secrets

```
Debug=false
APP_NAME=default
SERVICE_NAME=<Service name> 
LOG_TRANSPORTS=console,files,datadog #logs transports, only one is required and others are optional
LOG_FILE=hash.log #required if you are using files as log transport 
DD_API_KEY=<Datadog API KEY> #required only if you are sending logs to datadog
```

2. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

3. Update the default templates at `apps/default`

    a. Update `apps/default/init.yaml`

    b. Add/update the request templates here `apps/default/templates`

> You can also create a new application templates (documentation link)


4. Run HASH

```
node app.js
```
> For production grade deployment explore running with PM2 or advanced deployment with Docker & Kubernetes


## Customization and configuration

You can customize the default application in `apps/default` or create a new application `apps/<your-app>`

Example request template:

```yaml
id: sqli-error
info:
    title: "SQL error honeytrap"
requests:
  - isTrap: false 
    expect:
      method: GET
      path: '/author/:Id([0-9]+)'
    reply:
      status: 200
      headers:
        content-type: "text/html"
      body: 
        view: "author.html"
  - isTrap: true 
    expect:
      method: GET
      path: '/author/:Id'
    reply:
      status: 500
      headers:
        content-type: "text/html"
      body: 
        contents: "You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '' at line 2"
```

## Future work
- [ ] Create examples folder to show HASH features
- [ ] Add unit & integration tests 
- [ ] Ability to import API documentation formats (swagger, postman ..etc)
- [ ] Package hash as module for easier distribution
