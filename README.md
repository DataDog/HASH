    b. add/update the request templates here `apps/default/templates`

> you can also create a new application templates (read the document)


4. Run HASH

```
nodejs app.js
```
> For production grade deployment explore running with PM2 or advanced deployment with Docker & Kubernetes




## Customization and configuration

You can customize the default application in `apps/default` or create a new application `apps/<your-app>`

example request template

```yaml
id: sqli-error
info:
    title: "SQL error honeytrap"
requests:
  - isTrap: false 
    expect:
      method: GET
      path: '/author/:Id([0-9]+)'
    reply:
      status: 200
      headers:

      body: 
        view: "author.html"
  - isTrap: true 
    expect:
      method: GET
      path: '/author/:Id'
    reply:
      status: 500
      headers:
        content-type: "text/html"
